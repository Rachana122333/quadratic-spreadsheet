# Supply Chain Data Analysis using AI Tools (Quadratic + N8N)

This project demonstrates how AI-powered tools like **Quadratic** and **N8N** can automate supply chain data analysis and reporting.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Automated data ingestion of sales & delivery data into Postgres using **n8n** workflows.
- Performed KPI calculations (On-Time, In-Full, OTIF) using Quadratic (AI-powered spreadsheet).
- Automated reporting and dashboards for supply chain bottlenecks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Quadratic (AI Spreadsheet)
- N8N (Workflow Automation)
- PostgreSQL
- GitHub (Documentation & Version Control)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identified supplier delays that reduced OTIF by 12%.
- Improved reporting efficiency with automation (0 manual intervention).
- Detected demand forecasting gaps through AI-assisted spreadsheet analysis.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `workflows/` → N8N workflow JSON exports.
- `data/` → Sample anonymized datasets.
- `README.md` → Project documentation.

## ▶️ How to Use
1. Import JSON files from `workflows/` into your n8n instance.
2. Configure Postgres & Gmail credentials.
3. Run the workflow to ingest supply chain data automatically.
